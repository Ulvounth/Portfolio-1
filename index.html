                    <p><strong>Hey there</strong>, I'm Andreas! Originally from Sunndals√∏ra, Norway, I'm currently living in sunny Spain while I dive into the world of Front-end Development.
                        Right now, I'm a student at the Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, where I'm learning the ropes of Front-end Development. It's a journey I'm excited about and fully committed to.
                        Front-end Development has become my true passion. I love how it constantly changes, and I'm always learning something new. It's a field where I can combine my creativity with my technical skills.
                        Outside of coding, I'm all about exploring. Spain's a fantastic place for that, with its mix of nature and culture. I'm all about finding that balance between work and play. My journey is just beginning, and I'm looking forward to growing as a Front-end Developer.</p>

                    <h3>Community Science Museum</h3>
                    <p>This was my semester project in which we were tasked with creating a website for a Community Science Museum. The intended audience comprised children between the ages of 7 and 15, as well as families with younger children and schools. The website was required to consist of a minimum of 4-6 pages, with the code written in semantically structured and neatly indented HTML. Additionally, we were expected to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles for the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Furthermore, the site needed to be responsive to various screen sizes and devices.</p>

                    <p>This was my Project Exam, where we were tasked with creating a blog website from scratch. During this project, I independently selected the theme and content, and I was responsible for every aspect of its development, including wireframing/prototyping, design, and HTML. In addition to utilizing CSS and HTML, I employed JavaScript to retrieve data from a WordPress page containing all the blog content. As part of this project, we were required to demonstrate our proficiency in using REST APIs and other JavaScript features, such as implementing onclick modals for images and form validation for the contact form.</p>
